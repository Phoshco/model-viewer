MMDGenshin
Shader written for MMD to replicate the visual style of Genshin Impact

Important
This is not the full shader but because my motivation is starting to waver, I'm releasing the shader as a beta for now. I will continue to work on it as normal. This page could go down or change completely at any point.

How to use
I won't provide any files. There are tutorials online about how to make the textures needed
Download from the releases page
Create a copy of the material_default.fx and change the settings for the model youre working on
In PMX Editor, put the ramp texture in the toon slot.
Put the lightmaps in the spa/sph slot and set the type to subtex for everything that isnt the face.
For the face, you will want to load the _shadow texture into the spa/sph slot instead and set it to either Add or Multu.
Rules
You may distribute your edited material files but do not repackage the entire original shader. That means only the .fx file you load into mmd should be shared.
If you use this shader, you must write the shader name or mine somwhere where it is easily seen.
You are free to use this as a reference for your own shaders but just like above, credit me where it will be easily seen.
